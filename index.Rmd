## Why try feature selection?

- Feature selection is:
  - Picking predictors to use for machine learning prediction
  - The least advanced part of machine learning
  - Still dependent on human assistance, e.g. domain knowledge
- But it's important:
  - Unneeded features slow down classifier training
  - Junk features can facilitate overfitting
- And hard (literally -- it's intractable):
  - On a dataset with $N$ features, finding the best means checking $2^N$ combinations
  - The most useful features may depend on the specific classifier

## Try doing it yourself!

- This app lets you:
  - Compare features and outcome in a dataset
  - Select features, train the classifier, see the accuracy
  - Try to get the highest accuracy with fewest features
- Would you keep both these features? Hmm...

```{r feature_plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
require(ElemStatLearn, quietly=TRUE)
data(SAheart)
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1))
plot(SAheart$adiposity, SAheart$obesity, xlab="Adiposity", ylab="Obesity", col="red")
c <- round(cor(SAheart$adiposity, SAheart$obesity), digits=3)
usr <- par("usr")
xmid <- (usr[1] + usr[2]) / 2
ytop <- usr[4] - 2
text(xmid, ytop, sprintf("Correlation = %.3f", c))
```

## Behind the scenes

- What is the app doing?
  - Uses the South Africa heart disease dataset
    from the R [ElemStatLearn package](http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/ElemStatLearn)
  - Trains a support vector machine with polynomial kernel
    from the R [kernlab package](http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/kernlab)
  - Shows cross-validation accuracy
- This is a tricky dataset for feature selection
  - No clear un-useful features
  - Small dataset size
  - Few features are highly correlated
- Ready to play?
